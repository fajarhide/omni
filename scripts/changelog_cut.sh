# the Rust side skipping names starting with `.` so a macOS `.DS_Store` is not
# reported as unreleased work.

# disagree on and `544.fixed.txt` fell through both: counted by neither, folded by
# neither, gone from the release notes with nothing said. The mistyped *section*
# case survives and is what this guard is for, so fail before `CHANGELOG.md` is
