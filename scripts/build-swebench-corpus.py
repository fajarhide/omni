"""#838. A second benchmark corpus, built from SWE-bench Verified.

Every figure OMNI publishes comes from `bench-corpus/`, which is frozen on one
machine and whose payloads stay local (#704). A reader has to take the number on
trust. This builds a corpus anyone can rebuild byte for byte, because every input
is public and pinned: SWE-bench Verified names a repository and a base commit per
instance, and the instance list is written into the manifest.

**No model, no key, no container, no spend.** The commands are a fixed script, not
what an agent chose, so this measures compression on realistic payloads and says
nothing about task success. The arm that answers task success runs a real agent
against both `OMNI_PASSTHROUGH` settings and costs money; it is deliberately not
here.

**Every command has to be deterministic given the commit**, or the corpus hash
changes per machine and the whole point is lost. That rules out `ls -la` (mode,
owner, timestamps), bare `grep -r` (directory order) and anything touching the
clock. Where order is not guaranteed the output is piped through `sort`.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/build-swebench-corpus.py --instances 40 --stride 12
    OMNI_BENCH_CORPUS=swebench-corpus/traces.jsonl ./scripts/bench.sh

Output, under `swebench-corpus/`, which is not committed: the clones are large and
the file is rebuildable from the manifest's instance list.
