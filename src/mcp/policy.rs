//! Which of OMNI's MCP tools a host is told about.
//!
//! An advertised tool sits at position 0 of every request, so it is re-read once
//! per request for the whole session, while a distilled tool result is re-read a
//! median of 64 times and then stops. That is why this list is priced rather than
//! curated: measured 2026-08-15, the 25 tools OMNI used to advertise cost 4,940
//! bytes for the 16 nobody ever called, about twice what the distillers earned in
//! the median session that pushed more than 50 KB through the hook.
//!
//! `FULL` carries the current measurement. It is re-run with
//! `docs/internal/transcript-probes/mcp_surface.py`, and a tool added without
//! re-running it has no price behind it.
//!
//! The set is chosen by `Tier`, which already exists and is what `doctor`
//! prints, so this module adds no second opinion about what a host can do.

/// ```text

/// `omni_context_breakdown` printed, and `omni stats --view detail` carries
/// `omni_history`'s rows with repeats folded into one line and a count rather
/// than listed per call. `omni_recall` and `omni_find_noise` have no CLI
