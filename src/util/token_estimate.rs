/// `cl100k_base` count, and every caller had to pick one, so the same column in
/// `omni stats` was computed two different ways depending on which path filled
/// the row (#174). The exact one is gone, for two reasons.
///
/// It counted against the wrong vocabulary. `cl100k_base` is GPT-3.5/4's
/// encoding, not Claude's, so it was a precise answer to a question nobody
/// asked, which is the failure mode this project is named after.
///
/// And it dominated the hook. Measured by removal on the release binary, same
/// payload, 10 runs each: the post-hook's median wall clock went from **53.8 ms
/// to 19.5 ms**. Loading that vocabulary was **34.3 ms, 64% of every hooked
/// command**, spent on a reporting column. `AGENTS.md` budgets the whole hook
/// at 10 ms.
///
/// What it bought was 4.9%. Calibrated against `cl100k_base` over 4,000 real
/// traces from this installation (37.9 MB): the aggregate is **3.614 bytes per
/// token**, median 3.61, p10 2.94, p90 4.13. `Mixed` is 3.6 for that reason and
/// no other; the divisor is measured, not chosen. The remaining hints are
/// untouched, because nothing here measured them.
