// copy in `build.rs` would be untestable and would drift.
//
// Plain `//` comments, not `//!`: an inner doc comment is only valid at the top
// of a module, and this file is spliced into the middle of `build.rs`.

/// Count top-level bullets under `## [Unreleased]`, stopping at the next

/// Only lines starting with `- ` at column zero count. The section nests
/// `### Added` / `### Fixed` groups and wraps long entries across lines, and
/// neither should inflate the number, a wrong count here becomes a wrong claim
/// in `omni doctor`, which is the thing this project exists to avoid.
// Dead in the `omni` binary by design: the binary reads the *result* through
// `OMNI_UNRELEASED_ENTRIES`, which `build.rs` computed by calling this at
// compile time. It is compiled into the crate so the tests below cover the code
// the build script actually runs, rather than a copy of it.
