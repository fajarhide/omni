//! Where `doctor_check` writes its human-readable report.
//!
//! `omni doctor --json` promises a document to a program, but each integration
//! wrote its report straight to stdout, so the JSON began at line 59 and `jq`
//! died on the first character (#353).
//!
//! The obvious fix is to thread a writer through `doctor_check`. It is worse
//! than it looks: several integrations report from inside a closure
//! (`let fmt_hook = |name, present| ...`), so a `&mut dyn Write` parameter would
//! be borrowed by the closure and unusable for the rest of the function. A sink
//! the caller redirects keeps those closures untouched and leaves one obvious
//! place to change where the report goes.
//!
//! Thread-local rather than global: `capture` must not silence a report running
//! on another thread, which a shared flag would do.
