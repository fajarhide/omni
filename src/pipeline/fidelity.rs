//! The check that runs after everything else: did we delete the answer.
//!
//! OMNI's invariants constrain the **input** to each stage: unsure means
//! structured, a distiller that parsed nothing returns the input, a failed
//! command passes through. Nothing looked at the **output** and asked whether a
//! class of content that entered had survived.
//!
//! #458 is what that costs. The ledger folded a `TypeError` because the line had
//! been shown earlier in the session, and the re-run of a still-failing script
//! reached the model as source context with no statement of what went wrong. The
//! ledger fix stops that specific fold; this stops the whole class, including
//! from stages that do not exist yet.
//!
//! Deliberately one property, not a framework. Failure lines are the class where
//! deletion is worst: an agent that cannot see the error concludes the failure is
//! gone, which is the fabricated-success mode this project exists to prevent.

/// Whether `output` still states the failure that `input` stated.
///
/// `true` when the input carried no failure at all, which is most payloads and
/// is why this is cheap: the scan stops at the first failing line and most
/// outputs never reach the second half.
