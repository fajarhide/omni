//! The session ledger: what this agent has already been shown.
//!
//! Every filter in `src/distillers/` answers the same question, one command at a
//! time: given this output, what can be dropped. The ledger answers a different
//! one: given everything shown in this session, what is this output repeating.
//! The two are **orthogonal**, and the corpus says so. Replayed over 7,019
//! model-facing traces on 2026-08-10, 25.3% of raw bytes were lines already seen
//! and **22.9% still were after every distiller had run**. Filtering removes 5.2%
//! of bytes and barely dents repetition.
//!
//! It also reaches the class nothing else can. File reads are the largest class
//! in the corpus at 1.53 MB, and the filters save **0.0%** of it, because you
//! cannot strip lines from a file the agent asked to see without guessing which
//! parts it meant. The ledger takes 24.8% of the same class without guessing
//! anything: those lines were already delivered once.
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! A **run** of consecutive lines that were all emitted earlier in this session
//! becomes one marker naming the count and an `omni_retrieve` handle. Everything
//! else passes through byte for byte.
//!
//! ## The rules it inherits
//!
//! - **Append-only.** It only ever reduces the output of the command in flight,
//!   and never rewrites anything already delivered. That is what keeps the
//!   upstream prompt cache intact: a cache works on a prefix, and shortening the
//!   suffix costs nothing. Retroactive compaction is the move that would destroy
//!   it, and nothing here reaches backwards.
//! - **Deterministic.** The same ledger state must render byte-identical output.
//!   The handle is the content address and carries no timestamp. An earlier
//!   `{ts_ns}_{hash}` handle shipped and made 4 of 73 repeated inputs emit
//!   different bytes; it was fixed with no test behind it, so
//!   `renders_identical_bytes_for_identical_state` is that test.
//! - **Nothing is lost.** A run is archived before its marker is written, and a
//!   failed archive means the run stays verbatim. A handle that does not resolve
//!   is the one defect this whole mechanism cannot have (#388).
//! - **Unknown means untouched.** Structured payloads never reach here; the
//!   caller gates on `pipeline::format::sniff` exactly as collapse does.
