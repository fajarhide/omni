//! Was an MCP tool and nothing else. It sat in the prefix of every request on a
//! Full-tier host at 189 bytes, and `mcp::policy::FULL` admits a tool on one
//! stated rule, "called at least once in the corpus": across 253 recorded
//! sessions `omni_context` is the only advertised tool with **zero** calls ever,
//! and the three places OMNI recommended it appear zero times in 10,578 traces
//! (#609).
//!
//! Moving it here rather than deleting it keeps the capability and stops charging
//! for it. A CLI subcommand costs nothing per request, and an agent that wants it
//! runs it in the shell OMNI already hooks. `omni_run` was the door named here
//! until it was priced off the Full tier too (#609); it still is on a
//! Handoff-first host, which is the tier that has no shell of its own.
