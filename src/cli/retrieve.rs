//! `omni retrieve <handle>`, the recovery path every marker names.
//!
//! Filed as #452 from a real session: the markers promised `omni_retrieve("…")`,
//! which is an MCP tool, and on a host where that tool is not surfaced the agent
//! was left with a hole in the file it had just read and no way to fill it. The
//! MCP tool works where MCP works; this exists so the promise does not depend on
//! that.
//!
//! It is also the reason the marker text changed. A marker naming a tool call
//! that only some hosts can make is a handle that does not resolve, and #388
//! settled that a handle which does not resolve is the one defect this mechanism
//! cannot have.
