/// 93% compression and 6,194 tokens for a distillation the model never saw
/// (#212).

/// The middle row was the knee for those two bounds, and both bounds are now
/// gone, because the sweep above varied the wrong variable. A line count and a
/// byte count are proxies for the only question that decides the trade: does
/// this run save more than the marker replacing it costs. Nothing compared the
/// two, so a 3-line 150 byte run was rejected as too small while the 4-line
/// bound was quietly protecting the output from 11,406 runs averaging 23 bytes
/// (#450).
///
/// What replaces them is that comparison, stated directly.
///
/// The bytes a fold has to **save**, after the marker that replaces the run is
/// paid for. Measured over 6,656 claude_code traces, ledger contribution against

///
/// Judged the way the sweep above judged its own rows, in points per extra
/// marker, because a marker is an interruption in the output and the second
/// number is the one that costs fidelity. Dropping 200 to 150 buys 0.7 points
/// for 169 markers, which is a better trade than the 0.9 for 328 that sweep
/// accepted. Dropping 150 to 100 buys 0.6 for 240, which is the trade it
