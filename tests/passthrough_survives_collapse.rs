//! #214: a passthrough returns its input, so it can never beat the size
//! guardrail, so the hooks treated it as a distiller that punted and collapsed
//! it anyway. `python3` printing 40 distinct data rows came back as one
//! `[40 similar lines collapsed]` marker at a reported 95.7% saving — the #190
//! fix undone one stage later.
//!
//! The defect is only visible in composition, so this drives the built binary
//! rather than `distill_with_command`: the distiller was already correct and a
//! unit test over it passed in both directions.
//!
//! Unix-only, like `exec_fail_passthrough`: `omni exec` wraps in `cmd /C` on
//! Windows, which does not speak this syntax. The guard itself is OS-agnostic.
