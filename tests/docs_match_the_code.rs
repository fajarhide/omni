//! The manual, checked against the code it describes (#520).
//!
//! This class of defect has been fixed by hand four times: #180 named two
//! deleted subcommands, #185 two removed flags, #390 four whole documents, and
//! the sweep in #521 found `omni history` and `omni insight` sitting in shell
//! blocks that exit 1, plus a tool count reading 26 against 25 in the source.
//! Every round was found by a person happening to open one page.
//!
//! Two of the four kinds are mechanical, and this covers those. The fourth,
//! prose describing the pipeline in the wrong order, is not checkable here: the
//! fix for that is for two pages to stop each holding their own copy.
//!
//! **Why the source and not the binary.** Probing `omni <cmd>` for real would be
//! the honest level, and is unsafe: `reset` drops the database, `dashboard`
//! binds a port and blocks, `update` reaches the network. Reading the one
//! `match` that dispatches them keeps the single source of truth without
//! running anything.
