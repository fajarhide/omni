//! #155: a reader that closes early must not make OMNI panic.
//!
//! Rust sets `SIGPIPE` to `SIG_IGN` before `main`, so a write to a closed pipe
//! returns `EPIPE` and `println!` panics on it — `omni --help | head -1` printed
//! a panic and a backtrace note where `ls | head` prints nothing. `main` now
//! restores `SIG_DFL`, which is what every other Unix tool does.
//!
//! Unix-only: `SIGPIPE` does not exist on Windows, where a closed pipe surfaces
//! as an ordinary write error and never reached the panicking path.
#![cfg(unix)]
