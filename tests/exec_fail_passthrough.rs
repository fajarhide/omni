//! #122: `omni exec` must pass a failed command's stdout through verbatim and
//! never distill it — the same invariant #120 enforced on the hook path, applied
//! where the exit code comes from the wrapped child rather than the agent JSON.
//!
//! Unix-only: the reproduction drives a POSIX `sh` loop. On Windows `omni exec`
//! wraps commands in `cmd /C`, which does not speak this syntax; the gate itself
//! is OS-agnostic (`cli::exec`), only the test's shell script is not.
