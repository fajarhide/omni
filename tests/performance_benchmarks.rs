//! Guards against pathological slowdowns — a hang, a deadlock, an accidental
//! O(n²). Not benchmarks: these run under `cargo test` on shared CI runners,
//! where wall-clock time measures the runner's load as much as our code.
//!
//! So every bound here is **catastrophic-only**: orders of magnitude above the
//! design target named in each test. A tight bound cannot tell "the code got
//! slower" from "the runner was busy" — `bench_handoff_export_latency` proved
//! it, failing at 100ms on Windows and passing on a rerun of the same commit,
//! reddening an unrelated PR.
//!
//! Real performance tracking lives in `benches/pipeline.rs` (criterion,
//! `cargo bench`), which measures against a baseline instead of a magic number.
