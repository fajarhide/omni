//! #384: Cursor registers `stop`, `postToolUse` and `postToolUseFailure`, and
//! every one fell through the dispatcher's exact PascalCase match and did
//! nothing, while `omni doctor` reported them installed because the entries were
//! in the file.
//!
//! Driven through the binary because the defect had two layers: the dispatcher
//! routes on the event name, and the handler then re-checks it. Fixing either
//! one alone leaves the path dead, and a unit test on the mapping would pass in
//! that state.
