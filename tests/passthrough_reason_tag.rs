//! Every gate names itself in `passthrough_events.reason`.
//!
//! The reason used to be a `[tag]` suffix on the command because there was no
//! column for it (#254), and two of the four gates wrote the bare command, which
//! made a signal file that stripped its whole input and a distiller too weak to
//! keep indistinguishable in the table this project queries to decide what to
//! build. #441 gave it a column; these tests moved with it and assert the same
//! property, that no recorded passthrough is ambiguous between the seven gates.
