# OMNI

**Your AI agent pays to read the same output over and over. OMNI stops that.**

One small program between your terminal and your agent. Local, no API key, no proxy.
Install it and you never type its name again.

```bash
brew install fajarhide/tap/omni && omni init
```

Inside Claude Code, two lines and the agent does the rest:

```
/plugin marketplace add fajarhide/omni
/plugin install omni@omni
```

## What that buys, measured

| | |
|---|---:|
| a file your agent reads twice | **97.2%** off the second read |
| `git log -15` | **94%** smaller, every commit kept |
| `cargo test`, 490 passed and 10 failed | **92.9%** smaller, the failures kept |
| build and test output across the corpus | **78.0%** |
| the tool definitions in every request | **4,940 bytes** lighter |

Every one of those replays on your own history. That is the point of the rest of this
page.

## The problem, in one screen

Your agent runs a test suite. Four hundred lines come back, one of them matters.

```
$ cargo test
    Compiling omni v0.7.5
     Running unittests src/lib.rs
running 412 tests
test pipeline::scorer::tests::scores_errors_critical ... ok
... 409 more lines of "ok" ...
test result: FAILED. 411 passed; 1 failed
```

The failure survives. The 406 lines of `ok` do not. A handle on the last line brings
every one of them back, byte for byte, if anything ever needs them.

## The part nobody else does

Filtering noise is the easy half, and several tools do it. Here is the harder half, and
it is where most of OMNI's saving comes from.

Your agent reads a file. Three turns later it reads the same file again, because nothing
remembered the first read. You pay full price both times.

OMNI remembers. The second read comes back as one line:

```
[OMNI: 178 lines already shown, omni retrieve 0000000000000000]
```

**A 7.6 KB file read twice costs 7.6 KB and then 214 bytes.** Nothing was deleted: those
lines are already in your agent's context from the first read, so sending them again buys
nothing. The handle is there in case they scroll out of reach.

This is the ledger, and on real command histories it does more work than every filter
combined.

## Prove it on your own machine

Most tools in this space ask you to trust a number from someone else's laptop. Run these
instead:

```bash
omni stats                     # what OMNI did on your history, in counted bytes
omni retrieve <handle>         # any handle from any marker, printed back byte for byte
```

Every figure on this site comes from a corpus you can rebuild.
[Benchmarks](develop/benchmarks.md) has the method and the exact command for each row,
including every head-to-head we have run against the closest comparable tools.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **Longer sessions** | Less context spent on ceremony means more turns before you hit the wall, and fewer compactions that lose your thread. |
| **Lower bills** | 14.9% fewer bytes across 6,656 real commands. On file reads, 25.0%. On `git`, 22.1%. On build and test output, 78.0%. |
| **Nothing lost** | Everything removed is archived locally. `omni retrieve <handle>` prints it back. |
| **Nothing invented** | If OMNI cannot understand output, it hands it back untouched rather than guessing. |
| **Memory between sessions** | Close your editor, come back tomorrow, switch from Claude Code to Codex: the project context is still there. |
| **Nothing to change** | No proxy, no API key, no command to prefix. Install it and use your terminal normally. |

## Where it actually helps

[Where OMNI helps](concepts/use-cases.md) walks through the situations with the real
numbers attached, including where it stands aside and why that is the right call.

## Start here

**Just want it working.** [Install](use/install.md) takes about five minutes. Then read
[Reading the markers](use/markers.md), which is the one page worth your time, because the
markers are how OMNI tells you what it did.

**Want to understand it first.** [What OMNI is](concepts/what-it-is.md), then
[How it decides what to cut](concepts/how-it-decides.md), then [The ledger](concepts/the-ledger.md).

## Three things it will not do

**It will not send anything anywhere.** Every stage runs on your machine and the archive
is a SQLite file in your home directory.

**It will not sit between you and your model.** There is no proxy and no API key handed to
a local process. That was [decided against](develop/direction.md#non-goals) on purpose,
and the reasoning is written down.

**It will not quietly guess.** A stage that failed to understand its input hands the input
back unchanged. Structured data like JSON and YAML is never touched at all. Anything
removed leaves a marker saying so. Those three rules outrank compression, in that order,
every time they conflict.

## What the numbers actually say

OMNI is selective, and that is where its leverage comes from. It goes after the class
that dominates an agent's context, the same file read again and again. On the 5,984
command corpus replayed on 0.7.5, that class is the largest by bytes and the ledger
takes **89.6%** off it. A file your agent reads twice comes back **97.2%** smaller the
second time.

A file that changed between the two reads still folds around the change. Each fold keeps
the line count of what it replaced, so the lines you did not see moved stay on the numbers
your editor gives them.

Those figures come from one week, and the trace log keeps seven days, so that week cannot be
replayed again. [Benchmarks](develop/benchmarks.md) publishes each run with its corpus, and
what any of them is worth to you depends on how much your own week repeats itself.

Where there is nothing safe to take it takes nothing. A two-line `git status` has no
ceremony to drop and no repeats to fold, and a JSON payload a later step parses is never
touched at all, so OMNI hands those straight back rather than inventing a saving to
report.

The **14.9%** in the table above is a different corpus on purpose: the same harness over
a week of ordinary work, with every one of those hands-back counted in alongside the
wins. It is an average over that mix, not a promise for yours. The per-class rows are
what predict your own workload and they run from **4.3%** on search to **89.6%** on file
re-reads, so find the classes you actually run. Both corpora, the method, and every
unflattering figure we have are on [Benchmarks](develop/benchmarks.md).

Against the closest comparable tools on identical bytes, the ledger is what puts OMNI
ahead overall. The full head-to-head, including the arm where another tool's filters
edge ours and what combining the two would give, is on
[Benchmarks](develop/benchmarks.md).

If you want a number that describes your machine rather than someone else's, run
`omni stats` after a few days.

## Where to ask

[Discord](https://discord.gg/zHTuvZhF2M) for questions, and especially for the case this
project cares about most: OMNI stating a result its input does not support. The
[issue tracker](https://github.com/fajarhide/omni/issues) works too. A report with the raw
and distilled output side by side gets fixed either way.
